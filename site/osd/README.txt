Hello,

I have created this theme for the purpose of helping indexhibit users who may not have extensive knowledge of css. I have  commented the original code to be easily altered and understood. I hope it also serves to help people figure out what each element does.

I have also styled the theme to look pretty, and could be used as is. 

This theme was developed in collaboration with Mushon Zer-Aviv as part of his class 'Open Source Design' at Parsons The New School for Design. You can check out our class blog (http://www.mushon.com/fall08/osd/) to see our process and other great indexhibit plug-ins and tutorials made by other students. 

INSTRUCTIONS

To activate this theme unpack inside the "site" folder within the main "ndxz-studio" folder.

This is a Open Source work in progress. If you have any suggestions or comments contact me: info@ednacional.com
